## 🎯 Why This Manifesto Exists

Over the years, the term **DevOps** has been distorted and repeatedly misused.

It has too often been reduced to a role focused exclusively on:
- operating cloud platforms  
- managing infrastructure  
- provisioning environments  
- acting as “cloud sysadmins” under a new title  

This misunderstanding has created a generation of so-called **SoloOps** or **SiloOps** profiles:  
people restricted to operating tools and platforms, without the engineering skills required to shape, evolve, and sustain the lifecycle of modern software systems.

But **DevOps is not operations-only**.

**DevOps is engineering** — the ability to design, structure, automate, containerize, standardize, and modernize software across its entire lifecycle, with a primary focus on improving developer experience and development environments.

This manifesto was created to:
- reclaim the original engineering nature of DevOps  
- promote a holistic view that starts from development, not production  
- define standards that enable better, more evolvable software  
- fight the misconception that DevOps = cloud sysadmin  
- encourage organizations to value DevOps as a discipline, not a silo
